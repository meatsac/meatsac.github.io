** Why is your blog titled meatsac?**

That is a fair question. I was listening to a podcaster, who jokingly referred to the human characters in the story being told as "Meat Sacks". I like this because it reminds us that we're all that we have in the end. Eckhart Tolle reguarly speaks of the "illusion of self" and how this illusion (or ego) can be a great source of pain that we don't have to live by. So my blog title is a "tongue in cheek" reminder of this!
